    <h4>Web terms & anatomy</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><b>html</b> = hypertext markup language. the language in which webpages/documents are written</li>
      <ul>
        <li><b>markup</b> = what the page looks like</li>
      </ul>
      <li><b>url</b> = location of a document </li>
      <li><b>http</b> = protocol (hypertext transfer) by which a browser makes requests to servers </li>
      <li><b>www</b> is basically an enormous (billions) collection of html documents </li>
      <li>the parts of the internet system:
        <div><img src="components.png" height="150" alt="whoops"></div>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>A = the browser program on your computer</li>
            <li>B = the internet</li>
            <li>C = http requests</li>
            <li>D = the server, on which the webpage ultimately resides</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>this is <b>not</b> a webpage - there is no server here, just a file on a computer</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Elements & tags</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>anchors (<b>&lt;a&gt;</b>) are for making links</li>
      <ul>
        <li>usually (always?) they have an attribute "href" with the url as its value</li>
        <li>the text between the tags is what's written in the page</li>
      </ul>
      <li><b>&lt;img&gt;</b> is for images</li>
      <ul>
        <li>the <b>alt</b> value will be shown if the <b>src</b> value (the image file and path) can't be found/loaded</li>
        <li>the image path can be a file name if it is stored in the same place as the document. otherwise it will probably be a url</li>
      </ul>
      <li>there are lots of tags for formatting, eg <b>&lt;b&gt;</b>, <em>&lt;em&gt;</em>, <strong>&lt;strong&gt;</strong></li>
      <li>most elements, including the aforementioned formatted elements, must have closing tags (eg <b>&lt;/b&gt;</b>) to mark the end of the element. if omitted, the change invoked by the opening tag will continue indefinitely (the computer is only as smart as the code you write)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Arranging text (basic)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>unless otherwise instructed, the browser will render the text as a continuous line, wrapping only when it gets to the edge of the window</li>
      <li>line breaks & white space have to be added with markup</li>
      <li>many elements, including <b>&lt;img&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;a&gt;</b> are likewise <em>inline</em></li>
      <li><b>&lt;span&gt;</b> is used to define an inline section, eg for applying a set of custom formatting attributes</li>
      <li>there are also <em>block</em> tags, which define sections with height and width - invisible boxes - eg: </li>
      <ul>
        <li><b>&lt;p&gt;</b> defines a new paragraph, with white space between it and the previous paragraph</li>
        <li><b>&lt;div&gt;</b> defines a new block, without inserting any white space</li>
      </ul>
      <li><b>&lt;br&gt;</b> inserts a line break, but does not create a text block</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Coding standards for HTML documents</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>you can just render text in a browser, with or without html, but a complete html doc should contain standard information that the browser needs:</li>
      <ul>
        <li><b>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</b> informs the browser that this is an html document (strictly speaking it means html 5; html 4.01 comes in 3 highly verbose flavours)</li>
        <li><b>&lt;html&gt;</b> contains all the actual html code on the page, in 2 subsections:</li>
        <ul>
          <li><b>&lt;head&gt;</b> contains metadata, including the page title and references to CSS and script files</li>
          <li><b>&lt;body&gt;</b> contains all the content</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <li>if you create an empty html file <em>Atom</em> has a helpful template that you can use to set up the doc outline</li>
      <li>html also has indenting standards as described in depth <a href="https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd000/parts/b920608d-be3c-4d5f-851f-6ab3eeb8997b/modules/8f2b6689-b7fd-4c54-9c13-99bb29278990/lessons/404b6925-2a6e-4617-8818-3bd890906f75/concepts/e40b5612-4666-46d5-aaab-581d28d00daf">here</a></li>
